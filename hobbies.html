            <h3>Writing / Blogging</h3>
            <p>Writing is a great hobby for programmers. You can combine your passion of writing with your passion for
                programming. Keeping a journal or writing a novel for fun can give you a great experience. Also, it is
                an amazing way of keeping a record of all what you’re thinking and memories.</p>

            <h3> Reading</h3>
            <p>47.4% of survey respondents had this as a hobby. Curl up in your favorite chair and read on to find out
                whodunit. I’m sure several of you have read a book series which was then turned into a movie like Harry
                Potter and thought: “The books were SO much better. The movie left out a lot of details and changed too
                many things.” I found many developers in hashnode who love to read, so it's clear that people who love
                to write, love to read!</p>
